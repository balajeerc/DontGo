TODO List:
---------
1. Read the game grid from a JSON file describing it.
	i) Describe a JSON format that specifies the entire grid.
		-First a list of 2-tuples describing vertex points √
		-A list of 2-tuples describing sides connecting any 2 vertices. √
		-Two list of indices, each list indicating the location of start pieces of each player. √
	ii)	Write a Blender script that exports a Blender mesh to DontGo grid √
	iii) Draw the vertex points with light grey dots. √
	iv) Draw the vertex connectivity
		-For first iteration, just draw all the connecting lines. √
		-Final version must draw the connectivity lines only when mouse is near/over a vertex/vertices.
	v) Draw dark opaque circles with colours corresponding to each player's colour representing the player pieces. √

2. Interacting with the pieces
	i) During mouse over on a piece, darken the color slightly.
	ii) During mouse click on a piece, draw another circle around indicating that it has been selected.
	iii) With a selected piece, if the player clicks another grid point
		-If the grid point is blank
			--If the move is legal, change the location of selected piece from previous to newly selected.
	iv) On mouse drag, from a selected piece to another piece belonging to same player, draw a string connecting the two.	 		

3. Thread sweeping
	i) When a piece is moved, and it is connected to another thread, calculate the area this thread sweeps in the process
		-For first iteration, this can be done by finding the equation of the circle corresponding to this sweep
	ii) Find all the vertices within the area of sweep
		-Iterate over all the points occupied by the opponent in the grid and locate those falling within this circle (or on it)
	iii) Eliminate all the pieces of opponent within this area of sweep

4. Interface interactions
	-Drag on shift and mouse drag.
	-Zoom on mouse wheel.
